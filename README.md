## Introduction to Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is an annual event encouraging participation in the open-source community. By contributing to open-source projects like this one, you can gain experience in the world of open-source contributions.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sohini3018/simple-todo-list-UI.git
```

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

```bash
cd simple-todo-list-UI
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### Step 3: Make Changes and Commit

Make your desired changes to the project, then commit them.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message"
```

### Step 4: Push Changes

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

## Avoiding Conflicts

To avoid conflicts, make sure to pull the latest changes from the main branch before making your own changes.

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

Then switch back to your branch:

```bash
git checkout your-branch-name
git merge main
```

## Best Practices for Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Branch Naming Convention**: Use a descriptive name for your branch. For example, if you're fixing a bug related to the UI, you might name your branch `fix-ui-bug`.
  
- **Meaningful Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. For example, instead of "Fixed a bug", you could write "Resolved issue with input validation".

- **One Feature per Pull Request**: Keep your changes focused. This makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge your PR.
